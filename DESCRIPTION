Title: Estimate Necessary Trial Counts for a Behavioral Task
Version: 1.0.0

Description: This package is designed to assist psychological/behavioral researchers
  in determining how long their experimental tasks need to be. Researchers often use
  the rule of thumb that "more trials is better", to reduce error in estimating parameters
  for an experimental participant, but participant fatigue and other constraints make it
  imperative for researchers to find the minimum number of trials for a given behavioral
  task that will reliably estimate parameters of interest. This package contains a series
  of functions that generate data from one simulated experimental participant for any of a
  set of common cognitive task paradigms, and report power in measuring single-participant
  parameters as a function of trial count.
